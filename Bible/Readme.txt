This folder, "Bible" is where the inScript Bible browser folders and files are uusually located.

If you are using these Github files to branch/setup your own version, copy the files from inscript into this Bible folder so all the existing hyperlinks work.

The inscript files/folders that are usually here are:

 - build (folder)
 - content (folder)
 - about (html file)
 - index (html file)

Once youve downloaded the BibleCard copy your inScript content into this Bible folder.
